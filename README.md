# Voting App - Django [Python]

- User model with registration implemented. User Registration, user Account Activation, Login and Logout are developed by Class-based views.
- When a user is registered, the user is prompted for a username, first_name, last_name, email and password. A prerequisite for registration is confirmation of email. A one-time link to activate your account is sent to your email.
- Implemented the ability for each user to view their Profile information and Edit the user Profile. Also, it is possible for the user to Delete his Profile.
- Each User has the opportunity to change his password in his personal Profile.
- Each User can see in their Profile all Polls in which the User has already voted, as well as - Polls to which the User has not yet voted.
- Also implements login through social networks such as GitHub, Google and Instagram.
- Only registered users who have confirmed their email and users logged in through social networks can vote.
- Each user can only vote once per poll.
- Implemented counter unique number of views by IP address.
- Implemented a Contact form for feedback. If the User is authorized - one window is available to him - for the Message Text, his username and his email are taken from the request. If the user is anonymous, he needs to enter the required fields - Name, Email and Message Text.
